## Node and npm

Versions are likely flexible within major releases:

- Node version: ^23.8.0
- npm version: ^11.3.0

## Setup

To run the code:

1.  **Install the Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    _(This might take a minute)_

2.  **Run the Dev Server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    _(Keep an eye on the terminal output. It should tell you where the development server is running, usually something like http://localhost:3000)_

---

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 or whichever link the console provided.

Click the 'Playground' button in the 'Items' card to navigate to /itemPlayground. It may take a second to load the first time.
